# CRUDoperation
A java web application (implementing CRUD) is showing home page (index.html) to user and navigating to different view pages(InsertEmployee.html, UpdateEmployee.html and DeleteEmployee.html) upon user request, followed by processing user request by implementing controllers (EmpViewController.java, EmployeeInsertController.java, EmployeeUpdateController.java and EmployeeDeleteController.java) and model (EmployeeModel.java) and by connecting to database and manipulating data (using EmployeeDao.java), finally rendering and displaying required output to user implementing view (ShowEmpData.jsp)
